**Create Arbitrary** will add on to the **Create** mod by adding recipes for the **Creative Only** parts for now.

This mod adds ingredients and parts to craft. This mod was designed to closely fit in to **Create** and Vanilla Minecraft so nothing stands out to much.

Create Arbitrary requires Create, you can also use JEI for recipes.
